## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 Next-Gen AI Architecture
*   **The Writer (`gemini-2.5-pro`)**: Handles heavy cognitive tasks like layout design, strategy narratives, and resume drafting with a massive thinking budget.
*   **The Judge (`gemini-2.5-pro`)**: A specialized "Surgical Refinement" agent that audits the generated resume HTML to fix formatting, ensure strict one-page fit, and scrub artifacts.
*   **The Assistant (`gemini-2.5-flash`)**: Powers fast tasks like job parsing and profile generation.

### ✨ Smart Automation
*   **Master Profile Wizard**: Don't have a master resume? The built-in 5-step wizard interviews you and generates a perfectly structured Markdown profile to use as your "Source of Truth".
*   **Smart Clipboard Auto-Fill**: One click analyzes the text in your clipboard to instantly populate the Job Title, Company, and Description fields. No more manual copy-pasting.
*   **Usage & Cost Tracker**: Monitor your token consumption and estimated API costs in real-time via the built-in dashboard.

### 🎨 Visual & Functional Power
*   **Modular Generation**: Choose exactly what you need. Only want a CV? Uncheck the rest. Need the full suite? Generate Cover Letter, Strategy, Interview Prep, and Outreach emails.
*   **Resume Skins**: Instantly transform the look of your resume with professional themes (Modern Blue, Executive Serif, Tech Minimalist) without regenerating content.
*   **WYSIWYG "Direct Edit"**: Toggle "Edit Mode" to click and type directly on the resume preview. No code required.
*   **Native PDF Export**: Generate clean, print-ready PDFs for your Resume and Cover Letter.

### 🗂️ Application Tracker & History
*   **Interactive Pipeline**: Manage your applications from "Applied" to "Offer". Visual timeline allows you to mark stages as current or add custom steps (e.g., "Home Assignment").
*   **After-the-Fact Generation**: Did you only generate a Resume initially? Go to your History, open the application, and click "Generate Cover Letter" to create missing assets using the original context.
*   **Persistent Data**: Your profile, API key, and application history are stored securely in your operating system's standard application data folder (`%APPDATA%`), ensuring they survive updates.
